    \nThis Streamlit application demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    classifier for image recognition, specifically trained on a dataset of smiles. 
    Users can interact with the app by uploading an image, and the CNN model will 
    predict the presence or absence of a smile in the image.
    \nTech Stack:
    Streamlit: A Python library for creating web apps.
    TensorFlow: Deep learning frameworks for building and training CNNs.
    App Functionality:
    Image Upload: The app provides a user interface for uploading an image file.
    CNN Inference: The image is passed through the trained CNN model, which 
    generates predictions.
    Prediction Display: The app displays the model's prediction on the presence 
    or absence of a smile in the image. 
    Benefits:
    \nUser-friendly Interface: Streamlit simplifies web app development, making 
    the CNN model accessible without coding knowledge.
    Interactive Exploration: Users can experiment with different images 
    and observe the model's performance.
    Educational Tool: The app can be a valuable tool for understanding CNNs and 
    their applications in image classification tasks.
